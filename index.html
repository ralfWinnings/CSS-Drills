                <p>In this  <span>enchanted</span> land of Antioch, TN you will find an abyss of people wondering the grounds. 
                    You will come to see that this land has a way of keeping its host hostage, with out the hosts' even knowing.
                    It shall take a person with strong will that also moves with a stillness about themselves. Some never make it out.

                <p>Welcome to the <span>New</span> World. Things have taking great change in the past 5 years as we walk into a new 
                    era. I expect big things to happen from this point forward.

                <p>Moving through life with a clear head is a <span>skill</span> that I have been practicing for a couple of years now.
                    With out a clear head, how could you focus? How could you set a goal and acomplish it?
                    I find that when i am clear of all influences in my life or mental noise, i am able to hear my own thoughts 
                    loud and clear. Thats why i prefer to move with a clear mind.
